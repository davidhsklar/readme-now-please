# Professional README Generator Starter Code

This is an node.js app that generates a readme based on user inputs.  It is simple, fast and effective.  Below is a video of me demonstrating how it works and how to use it.

The readme that is generated from this app can be found in "main" with the file name "readmeusergenerated".  Check it out if you can't see the video below.  Enjoy!
